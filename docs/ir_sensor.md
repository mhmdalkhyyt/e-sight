Usage
This PIR motion sensor can automatically and quickly open various types of incandescent, fluorescent lamps, buzzer, automatic doors, electric fans, automatic washing machine and dryer Machines and other devices, it is a high tech products.


Especially suitable for enterprises, hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and family aisles, corridors and other sensitive Sense of region, or for the security zone automatic lighting, lighting and alarm systems.
Also, it can work with Arduino or Raspberry Pi projects.
You can use these sensors to connect lamps at home as well.
Package Included:
5 X Stemedu HC-SR501 PIR Infrared Motion Sensor
HC-SR501 Pir Infrared IR Sensor  Body Motion Module for Arduino
Adjustable Delay Time

With induction blocking time (default setting: 3-4 seconds): After each induction output (high level to low level), the induction module can set a blocking time immediately, and sense in this time period The device does not receive any induction signal.
This function can realize the interval work (induction output time and blocking time), and can be applied to interval detection products; at the same time, this function can effectively suppress various interferences generated during load switching.

Features

1. Fully automatic induction: When someone enters its sensing range, input high level, and when people leave the sensing range, it will automatically delay and turn off high level. Output low level.
2. Photosensitive control (optional): The module has a reserved position, which can be set for photosensitive control, and does not sense during the day or when the light is strong. Photosensitive control is an optional function, and no photoresistor is installed at the factory. If necessary, please purchase the photoresistor separately and install it yourself.
3. Two trigger modes: L can not be repeated, H can be repeated. It can be selected by jumper, the default is H.
A. Non-repeatable trigger mode: After the high level is sensed, the output will automatically change from high to low as soon as the delay time ends.
B. Repeatable trigger mode: After the induction output is high, during the delay time, if there is a human body moving within its sensing range, its output will remain high until the person leaves. The delay will be high. The level changes to a low level (the sensing module will automatically extend a delay time period after detecting each activity of the human body, and the time of the last activity is the starting point of the delay time).
4. Micro power consumption: 65 microamps of quiescent current, especially suitable for electrical products powered by dry batteries.
